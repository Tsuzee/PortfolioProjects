This is a Unity 2D Shmup called Sky Legions. It was developed in Unity 4 and was the final project for my 2D Animation and Asset Production Class.
I designed the style and art for the game, made the animation assets and put everything into a
prebuilt unity project that was provided for us. My project is the farrD_Final application, the
Shmup file is the origanl base game.
